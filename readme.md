## Future

~~I would love to see someone release a full featured standalone version with the file/image upload placeholders, etc.~~

Yay, Durgesh created a node based fork of ghostdown with image upload placeholders:

Demo: http://ghosditor.herokuapp.com/ 

Star the repo: https://github.com/durgesh-priyaranjan/ghosditor

Now if only it was platform independent (not requiring node)

**What does that mean?**

It means you can use this pretty much any way you like. You can fork it. You can include it in a proprietary product, sell it, and not give us a dime. Pretty much the only thing you can't do is hold us accountable if anything goes wrong.
